# `cgp` - Context-Generic Programming in Rust

## Overview

The `cgp` project contains a collection of micro Rust crates that empowers _context-generic programming_ (CGP), a new modular programming paradigm in Rust.

To learn more about context-generic programming, check out the our website [contextgeneric.dev](https://contextgeneric.dev/), and our book [Context-Generic Programming Patterns](https://patterns.contextgeneric.dev/).

At the moment, the `cgp` crate its constructs are mostly undocumented within Rustdoc. The best way to understand CGP is to read the book [Context-Generic Programming Patterns](https://patterns.contextgeneric.dev/).
